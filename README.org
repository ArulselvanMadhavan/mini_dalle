* Mini-Dalle
This work is a port of the [[https://github.com/kuprel/min-dalle][python version of mini-dalle]] to OCaml
** How it works
- In the first run, it downloads the pretrained weights from the HF
  repo for mini-dalle and saves them in a directory called "pretrained".
- The weights take up about 7GB of space.
- Runs inference path using the pretrained weights to produce the image
- The subsequence runs reuse the existing weights to generate the image.
** How to run
#+begin_src bash
# Sets up a docker container with everything installed.
make mini-dalle
# set Opam env
eval $(opam env)
# Runs the mini dalle image generation steps
dune exec mini_dalle -- generate "cactus in a corn field" "cactus.png" --device=1
#+end_src
** Performance
- On Nvidia A100, ocaml version takes 28 seconds to generate 3x3 grid
  of images wheras the python version takes around 60 seconds to generate
  the 3x3 grid image
- On a 12 core Intel CPU, it takes about 10 minutes to generate 3x3
  grid of images
** Generated image
#+CAPTION: cactus in a corn field
#+NAME:   fig:cactus.png
